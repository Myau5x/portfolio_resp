# Portfolio
## Responsive Portfolio

Website that will contain my portfolio.
For now main goal of project was to create responsive site that look good on all devices. It was done using Bootstrap grid system.

### Where to look?

My [portfolio](https://myau5x.github.io/portfolio_resp/)

### Files and directories 

- `index.html` -- basic information about me
- `portfolio.html` -- my portfolio, now empty
- `contacts.html` -- form to contact me
- `ctyle.css` -- contains some styles that overwrite default bootstrap styles
- `images` -- contains photos used on website

### What I used 

Website is developed with Bootstrap.

Photos are done by myself.
