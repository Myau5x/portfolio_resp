Website that will contain my portfolio.
For now main goal of project was to create responsive site that look good on all devices. It was done using Bootstrap grid system.

### Files and directories 

- `index.html` -- basic information about me
- `portfolio.html` -- my portfolio, now empty
- `contacts.html` -- form to contact me
- `ctyle.css` -- contains some styles that overwrite default bootstrap styles
- `images' -- contains photos used on website
